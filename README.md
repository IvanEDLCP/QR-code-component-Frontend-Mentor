This is my first Frontend Mentor challenge, it had been a long time since I last wrote css code and this project helped me to review basic structure and concepts of markdown and styles, this is also the first time I write in a Markdown file and I find this kind of documentation interesting, I hope to continue learning and practicing web development in Frontend Mentor.
